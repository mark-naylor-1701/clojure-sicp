;; Examples

;; Trivial, but used in later examples and exercises.
(defn square
  "Return the result of a number muliplied by itself."
  [x]
  (* x x))

(defn sum-of-squares
  ""
  [x y]
  (+ (square x) (square y)))


;; Although defined in Math/abs, use this version to follow the text.
(defn abs
  ""
  [x]
  (cond (< x 0) (- x)
        :else x))

;; Example 1.1.7: Square Roots by Newton's Method
(def ^:dynamic *delta* 0.001)

(defn good-enough-1?
  [guess x]
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) *delta*))

(defn average
  [x y]
  (/ (+ x y) 2.0))

(defn improve
  [guess x]
  (average guess (/ x guess)))

(defn sqrt-iter-1
  [guess x]
  (if (good-enough-1? guess x)
    guess
    (sqrt-iter-1 (improve guess x)
               x)))

(defn sqrt-1
  [x]
  (sqrt-iter-1 1.0 x))

;; Exercise 1.2 Convert to prefix form
(def ex-1_2 (/
             (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 4/5))))
             (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7))))

;; Exercise 1.3 Define a procedure that takes three numbers and
;; returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.
(defn ex-1_3
  ""
  [x y z]
  (cond (and (>= x z) (>= y z)) (sum-of-squares x y)
        (and (>= x y) (>= z y)) (sum-of-squares x z)
        :else (sum-of-squares y z)))


;; Exercise 1.6. Alyssa P. Hacker doesn't see why if needs to be provided
;; as a special form. "Why can't I just define it as an ordinary
;; procedure in terms of cond?" she asks. Alyssa's friend Eva Lu Ator
;; claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of if:2

(defn new-if
  ""
  [predicate then-clause else-clause]
  (cond predicate then-clause
        :else     else-clause))

;; Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)

(defn sqrt-iter-new-if
  [guess x]
  (new-if (good-enough-1? guess   x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter-new-if (improve guess x)
                            x)))

;; Q: What happens if we run this?  A: Stack blows up because else clause always evaluated.


;; Exercise 1.7. The good-enough? test used in computing square roots
;; will not be very effective finding the square roots of very small
;; numbers. Also, in real computers, arithmetic operations are always
;; performed with limited precision. This makes our test inadequate
;; for very large numbers. these statements, with examples showing how
;; the test fails for small and large numbers. An strategy for
;; implementing good-enough? is to watch how guess changes from one
;; iteration to next and to stop when the change is a very small
;; fraction of the guess. Design a square-root procedure uses this
;; kind of end test. Does this work better for small and large
;; numbers?

(defn good-enough-2?
  [guess x prior]
  (< (/ (abs (- guess prior)) guess) *delta*))

(defn sqrt-iter-2
  ([guess x]
   (sqrt-iter-2 guess x -1.0))

  ([guess x prior]
   (if (good-enough-2? guess x prior)
     guess
     (sqrt-iter-2 (improve guess x)
                  x
                  guess))))

(defn sqrt-2
  [x]
  (sqrt-iter-2 1.0 x -1.0))
